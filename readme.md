# What is this?

This is a one page website displaying the employees of tretton37, it's also a code test provided by said company.

## Issues

I did not manage to make the site work in IE. At first I thought the issue was that I used **grid** to organise the employee cards but after some googling I came to the conclusion that my primary issue was that IE does not support fetch. I tried a few different solutions but did unfortunately not manage to solve the issue.

## Successes

I'm really pleased with the design. I tried to make something that not only represented tretton37 colour and style wise but also represented me. I have a weak spot for both borders and border-radius which are recurrent on the page.

I'm also pleased with the fact that it's tabbable, including the animations.

## Overall

I enjoyed this test a lot. Even though I did not manage to get 2 points on the \_testing/QA-column I'm very proud with what I have done. I did not use any framework or UI frameworks.
